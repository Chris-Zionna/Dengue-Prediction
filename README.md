**Dengue Severity Prediction: A Framework Combining Ensemble Learning, Feature Engineering, and Association Rule Mining**

**Introduction**

Dengue fever, a mosquito-borne viral illness, poses a significant global health challenge. Predicting dengue severity early can significantly improve patient care and public health outcomes by enabling early intervention and appropriate treatment strategies. This project presents a machine learning framework for enhanced dengue severity prediction, leveraging ensemble learning, feature engineering, and the potential of association rule mining.

**Data**

This project utilizes a dataset (https://kaggle.com/datasets/siddhvr/dengue-prediction) containing climate data and corresponding dengue cases with severity labels (e.g., 'Severe Risk', 'High Risk', etc.). The climate data likely includes features like temperature, humidity, precipitation, and other relevant factors that influence dengue transmission.

**Methodology**

The framework follows these key steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing:**
    - Load the dataset using pandas.
    - Explore and understand the data distribution using visualizations (e.g., histograms, boxplots).
    - Handle missing values (e.g., imputation or removal).
    - Perform label encoding on categorical variables like severity labels (using scikit-learn's LabelEncoder).

2. **Feature Engineering:**
    - Extract meaningful features from the climate data that might correlate with dengue severity. You can explore potential feature transformations or create new features based on domain knowledge.

3. **Association Rule Mining (Optional):**
   - Consider employing association rule mining techniques (e.g., using libraries like arules or mlxtend) to uncover hidden relationships between climate variables. These insights can inform feature selection or creation during feature engineering.

4. **Model Training and Evaluation:**
    - Separate the data into training and testing sets (e.g., 80% training, 20% testing).
    - Define multiple machine learning models for ensemble learning. Consider models like Random Forest Regressor, Decision Tree Regressor, Gradient Boosting Regressor, or others suitable for regression tasks. Experiment with hyperparameter tuning for each model to optimize performance.
    - Train each model on the training data.
    - Evaluate model performance on the testing data using metrics like root mean squared error (RMSE), R-squared score, and cross-validation accuracy.
    - Compare the performance of individual models and select a suitable ensemble learning approach (e.g., VotingRegressor).

5. **Ensemble Learning:**
    - Create an ensemble model by combining the chosen machine learning models using the VotingRegressor from scikit-learn. You can define voting weights based on the individual model performance.

6. **Model Prediction and Evaluation:**
    - Use the ensemble model to make predictions on unseen data (e.g., the testing set or future data).
    - Evaluate the ensemble model's performance using the same metrics as individual models.

7. **Visualization and Interpretation:**
    - Create informative visualizations to understand the relationships between climate features and dengue severity (e.g., scatter plots, boxplots with severity levels on the x-axis).
    - Interpret the ensemble model's predictions and potential relationships with climate features.
